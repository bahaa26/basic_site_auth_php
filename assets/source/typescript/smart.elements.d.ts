The following three types of objects are supported:---### 1. 'LayoutGroup'Represents a splitter or a group of layout panels. Use this type to create containers that organize multiple DockingLayout items (such as panels) in either horizontal or vertical arrangements.'Properties:'- 'type': '"LayoutGroup"' (required)- 'orientation': 'string' – Specifies the orientation of the splitter, either ''horizontal'' or ''vertical''.- 'size': 'string | number' – Sets the size of the splitter group.- 'items': 'Array' – An array of 'LayoutPanel' objects to be contained within this group.- 'resizeMode': 'string' – Specifies the resizing behavior. Valid values: ''none'', ''adjacent'', ''end'', ''proportional''.- 'resizeStep': 'number' – Determines the increment step used when resizing by splitter.- 'liveResize': 'boolean' – If true, resizing happens live as the splitter is dragged.---### 2. 'LayoutPanel'Represents a tabbed container (TabsWindow) within the DockingLayout. Each 'LayoutPanel' can hold one or more 'LayoutPanelItem' objects (tab items).'Properties:'- 'type': '"LayoutPanel"' (required)- 'id': 'string' – Unique identifier for the LayoutPanel.- 'autoHide': 'boolean' – If true, enables auto-hide for the panel.- 'autoHidePosition': 'string' – If 'autoHide' is enabled, specifies the hide position: ''top'', ''bottom'', ''left'', or ''right''.- 'dropPosition': 'string' – Determines where new items can be dropped when dragged. Options include: ''top'', ''bottom'', ''left'', ''right'', ''center'', ''header'', ''layout-top'', ''layout-bottom'', ''layout-left'', ''layout-right''. Positions with the 'layout-' prefix specifically refer to LayoutPanelItems within the panel.- 'label': 'string' – The visible label of the panel window.- 'tabPosition': 'string' – Controls the position of the tab labels within the panel.- 'layout': 'string | object' – Assigns the owning DockingLayout. Accepts either the string ID or a reference to the DockingLayout instance.- 'headerButtons': 'Array' – Defines which buttons are visible in the panel header. Options include '[]', or any combination of ''close'' and ''autoHide''.- 'tabCloseButtons': 'boolean' – Enables or disables a close button on each tab label within the panel.- 'tabOverflow': 'string' – Specifies how tab label overflow is handled (mirrors the jqxTabs 'overflow' property).- 'selectionMode': 'string' – Sets the tab selection mode (mirrors the jqxTabs 'selectionMode').- 'tabResize': 'boolean' – Allows resizing of tab labels (mirrors the jqxTabs 'resize' property).- 'locked': 'boolean' – Locks the panel size, preventing resizing.- 'max': 'number' – Sets the maximum allowed size for the panel.- 'min': 'number' – Sets the minimum allowed size for the panel.- 'size': 'string | number' – Defines the current size of the layout panel.- 'items': 'Array' – An array where each object defines a tab item in the panel.---### 3. 'LayoutPanelItem'Represents a single tab within a LayoutPanel (also known as a TabItem).'Properties:'- 'type': '"LayoutPanelItem"' (required)- 'id': 'string' – Unique identifier for this tab.- 'label': 'string' – The text label shown on the tab.- 'content': 'any' – The actual content of the tab. Can be any supported node, data, or HTML.- 'selected': 'boolean' – Indicates if this tab should be selected by default. By default, the first item is selected automatically.- 'draggable': 'boolean' – If false, disables drag-and-drop for the tab item.---'Summary'Use this property to configure complex, nested layouts comprising splitters (LayoutGroup), tabbed panels (LayoutPanel), and individual tab items (LayoutPanelItem).

Example:'''jsfilter: (event) => event.status === 'confirmed' && event.attendees.length > 2'''This custom function ensures only confirmed events with more than two attendees are shown in the Scheduler.'Summary:'  - Use an 'array of filter objects' for property-based filtering, supporting simple values or custom functions for each attribute.- Use a 'function' for comprehensive, event-level filtering based on any combination of criteria.This flexibility allows you to implement straightforward or highly customized filtering logic to match your application's requirements.
